# Game Development / Capstone Project Proposal

- **Name**: Jonathan Reed
- **Year and Qtr**: 2, 8
- **Additional Teammate (If working in team)**: none as of now

## Introduction:

- Provide context and motivations of the project.
  - Why did you decide to work on this project? I was inspired to make a video game this time as I think it would be enjoyable.
  - What are your goals for this project? make a small technical demo of an Alt-historical strategy game
- What do you project your final project will look like? Something like an RTS game on either a tile/grid or real movement
  - What are the specific features you deem required to implement for this project? algarythms are needed to perform a gameplay mechanic in where serviving soldiers gain veterancy
  - What are features that you would like to implement if given the time? a small playable area where action mechanics can be showcased and demmonstration of the veterancy system.
- (Pre-project)
  - How difficult do you think this project will be? I think there can be some tough points for sure and think the toughest will be getting the game to remember veterancy going further into the game
  - What skills do you plan to develop with this project that will be useful for your job search? demponstrate deep knowledge of complex systems in programes and how to troubleshoot code.
  - What is the industry like for this kind of application (such as mobile application, web development, data analysis, etc.)? i would declaire this to be an indi project, its not impossible for something like this to grab attention but thats not my intention with this project, im making it cuz I really like an anime.. lol

## Process Overview:

- Mention tools and artifacts used, such as version control and task managers.
  - Languages c++, c, c#
  - Frameworks Unreal engine
  - Libraries epic store assets
  - Version Control internal INI initiallization for Unreal
  - Systems you will deploy on (VR, Web, Mobile (Specifically Mac or Windows), Cross-Platform, etc.) Build for windows/mobile
- Resources that you have found that you will use ( This isn't set in stone )
  - Websites all I have is the ideas that I expressed to you on thursday
  - Books
  - YouTube Videos
- Explain team roles and procedures.
  - If working with someone else, what are the roles you both plan to have?
  - What features and functions will you both plan to work on?
    - This should be an equal distribution of responsibility. I will be grading per individual and if someone is pulling the weight of the other, I will grade accordingly. Also, reach out to me if this appears to be an issue.

## Requirements:

- What are the features that you plan to implement?
  - Note: Reach out to me if you need help defining what kind of features you would like to implement, how to achieve them, and if they are robust enough for this class.
  - Note: I will reach out to you if your project needs to be expanded upon. This is meant to be a showcase of skills and something to demonstrate at an interview.

## Project Timeline:

- Provide a timeline overview, possibly as a Gantt chart or sequential list of milestones.
  - Map out your idea for weekly project on your project.
    - This is just a rough idea of how you plan to implement each feature over the quarter.
    - This isn't set in stone. You will find out quickly somethings can be done in 1 day, and others take weeks. But this is a plan for you to try to follow.
    - Your will update your weekly progress about this in teams.
- Describe key phases and interesting details about each phase.
  - Examples for this are (Your big features)
    - Combining front end and back end
    - Implementing Database
    - Learning how to deploy your project online
    - Implementing your control system in your game
    - etc.

## Future Work:

- Discuss potential new features or improvements for future versions.
  - What are features that you would like to implement, but are beyond the 3-month mark?
- Address any originally planned features not implemented and reasons behind it.
