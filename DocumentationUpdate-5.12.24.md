## Features Added/Updated Since Last Update:

- Added some objects with reference ids for adding the blueprint scripting to later
- built out some blueprint classes for the physics interactions with the objects
- started instance flags for start and ammo count

## Issues Encountered

- the udemy guide is pretty good, the only issues ive ran into where some build differences as the course uses a prerelease build of UE5
- A good example of this is for some of the preset sceens built into the starter resources require my to make a copy of the sceen im working with so I dont have all my progeress deleted on reboot: the starter content overides any changes to the sceen on reboot.

## Lessons Learned

- learning the uscases for blueprint scripting in UE and the limitations that come with it. While it is very user friendly its not flexible at all.
- looking forward to testing the knowlage from this course into the finial project for this course.
