## Features Added/Updated Since Last Update:

- Full RTS camera controlls and functionality.
- built out blueprint classes and controllers for the camera. WASD and mouse pan and terrain collision.
- built a map for testing the camera

## Issues Encountered

- spent a long time working out the weird math involved with screen panning, the blueprint script ended up being huge and messy.
- ran into some issues with the camera collision actor, for a bit it was causing my engine to crash as I would shoot stright out of the map bounderies and running a stack trace showed that i had a bad memory leak.

## Lessons Learned

- I learned alot of building out my custom classes and functions in blueprint, like you said putting time into it by yourself is true trial by fire and you figure out really fast the things that you dont know.
- as the clock ticks closer to the end of the quarter im activly adjusting the scope of what I can do with the time I have left for this demo. I feel good about finishing the unit deployment and hero character. The last thing i'm probly going to work on is the Veterancy system. Id would like to get combat working but thats not looking too good atm.
