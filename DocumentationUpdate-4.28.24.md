# Game Development / Update 4.28.24

## Features Added/Updated Since Last Update:

- I did add a absract class for starting my huminoid and non-player-units
- the goal was to build out a foundation for unit interactions with out rewriting code : looking into librarys to hold many components and unit types that have avantagese or disavantages in certain cases. \*morral, terrain, inspired by hero ect..
- Hero class was made but nothings going on with it yet

## Issues Encountered

- most of my issues are figuring out how im going to aprroch my idea with out repeatedly gutting it whenever Id like to add something new.
- setting milestones for myself for this project _ getting the scaling of my representation of units working, having unit loss decress the size of the representation, tying the army to the hero unit, having the option to have a Leftenant _ classified as a hero unit.

## Lessons Learned

- I'm pretty sure that if I mess around with it i'll get somewhere with the idea but im not confident I have all the answers for building the functionality im looking for in Unreal 5.3 (I know it exist but I need to build it for my usecase)
- looking into udemy for learning more about unreal engine. I'm thinking I can try out to course for free but I may just buy it if nessary. I'd like to learn anyway.
